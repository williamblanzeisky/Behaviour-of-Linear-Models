# Behaviour-of-Linear-Models
Observing how linear model works on different conditions.

Models: LinearSVM, Logistic Regression

1. Observes how linear model behaves when multicolinearity is present in the dataset.
2. Observers how linear model decision boundary changes when outlier is present.
3. Observes how linear model behaves when the dataset is imbalanced.
4. Applying platt's scaling to get predict_proba of SVM.
5. Writing LinearSVC decision_function algorithm using RBF kernel from scratch.
